sum_of_sines_equals_zero
========================

set A of 3d vectors

set B of 3d vectors

3d rotation

apply 3d rotation to set B

pair each item in A with each in B

get each cross product

take result set, get all combinations

get cross product of each combination

take result set, get all combinations

get sum of sines of angles of each combination

choose the 3d rotation that causes the final sum to be zero
